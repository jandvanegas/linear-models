# Estimator of $\sigma^2$
Set up a simulation study to empirically demonstrate that the MLE of $\sigma^2$ 
is asymptotically unbiased. So we want you to repeat a simulation study for 
several choices of the sample size $n$ so as to show that the bias reduces as 
$n$ increases.

```{r}
estimate_beta <- function(n) {
  set.seed(75286)
  sigma2 <- 1
  x <- seq(1, 10, length.out = n)
  results <- data.frame(beta0Hat = NA, beta1Hat = NA, sigma.MLE = NA, sigma.MSE = NA)
  sim_number <- 100
  for (i in 1:sim_number) {
    y <- 90 + 0.5 * x + rnorm(n, sd = sqrt(sigma2))
    m <- lm(y ~ x)
    results[i, ] <- c(coef(m), sigma.MLE = mean(residuals(m)^2), sigma.MSE = sum(residuals(m)^2) / (n - 2))
  }
  return(results)
}
sample.sizes <- c(3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100)
sigma2.MLE <- c()
sigma2.MSE <- c()
for (n in sample.sizes) {
  results <- estimate_beta(n)
  sigma2.MLE <- c(sigma2.MLE, mean(results$sigma.MLE))
  sigma2.MSE <- c(sigma2.MSE, mean(results$sigma.MSE))
}

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(sample.sizes, sigma2.MLE,
  ylim = c(0, 1.2),
  xlab = "sample size", ylab = "MLE estimate of sigma^2",
  main = "MLE"
)
abline(h = 1, lty = 2, col = 2)

plot(sample.sizes, sigma2.MSE,
  ylim = c(0, 1.2),
  xlab = "sample size", ylab = "MSE estimate of sigma^2",
  main = "MSE"
