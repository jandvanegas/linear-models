# Exercise Smoking:

We are presented with a sample of 654 youths, aged 3 to 19 years, in the area 
of East Boston during middle to late 1970â€™s. Interest concerns the 
relationship between smoking and FEV (forced expiratory volume; it measures 
how much air a person can exhale during a forced breath, measured in liters). 
In the dataset, the smoke variable is already coded as a dummy variable: smoke
=0 refers to non-smokers and smoke=1 refers to smokers.

We read the data
```{r}
fev <- read.csv("Data/fevdata.txt", sep = " ")
names(fev) <- c("age", "fev", "height", "sex", "smoke")
```
Plot 
```{r}
boxplot(fev$fev ~ fev$smoke, ylab = "FEV (liters)", xlab = "smoke")
```

We create the model
```{r}
t.test(
  fev$fev ~ fev$smoke,
  var.equal = TRUE
)
```
